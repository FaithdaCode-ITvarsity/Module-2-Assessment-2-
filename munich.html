                   Closing out our list is the biopic on the events leading up to the second World War 2. The story predominantly follows two school friends who find themselves on the opposite sides of the table (one with the British and the other with the Germans) but ultimately trying to get a deal to work behind the backs of their respective leaders.
                   While the movie is by no means what you’d call a traditional WW2 movie, it’s got excellent performances from the entire cast and fleshes out the events, and provides additional context as to why such actions were taken (albeit controversial actions).</p>
