                   Apollo 10½: A Space Age Childhood – Picture: Minnow Mountain / Netflix
                   Written and directed by Richard Linklater, best known for Boyhood, Waking Life and Before Midnight, this beautifully animated movie is not only one of the best movies of 2022 but one of the best animated movies Netflix has ever released under its banner.
                   The movie follows two intertwined perspectives on the first moon landing in the summer of 1969 capturing both the efforts that went into making the event happen and how it impacted a young boy watching from afar.
                   Certified Fresh on RottenTomatoes, here’s what the consensus of the critics was:
                   “The sweetly nostalgic Apollo 10½ : A Space Age Childhood finds Richard Linklater reusing visual and thematic ingredients in a deeply personal, freshly inspired way.”</p>
