                     Three anthology stories play out in spectacular fashion across different periods of time in this stop-motion animated movie that will leave you with plenty of questions once the credits roll. Each of the stories are completely separate with only one thing in common, the house they reside in.
                     While the movie certainly slipped onto Netflix without much fanfare, critics loved it and Netflix is hoping for it to achieve a win for best TV movie at the Emmys.
                     Marya E. Gates of The Playlist succinctly summarized why the movie is so alluring saying the movie is “A striking showcase for the singular talents of its directors and the limitless possibilities of stop motion animation.”</p>
