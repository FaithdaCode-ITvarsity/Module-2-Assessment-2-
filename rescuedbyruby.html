                   Feel-good movies and shows are a surefire way to get good viewership and reviews and Rescued by Ruby is no exception. Grant Gustin swaps out his spandex superhero costume from The Flash in favor of a police uniform in this biopic.
                   The movie revolves around a state trooper with dreams of moving over to the K-9 department but faces an uphill battle to get there.
                   William Bibbiani for The Wrap said:
                   “Bright colors, wide angles, and plenty of Doggy Vision sequences never let us forget for one minute that theres nothing scary about this world, even though we know for a fact that there are quite a few murderers in it.”</p>
